<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO JEFFREY D!</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Star Wars Series</h3>
<p>It is too difficult to pick amoungst the nine Skywalker Saga movies which one is my absolute favorite.  The truth is that anytime I sit down to watch just one, I start with Episode 1 and over the coming week make my way through to Episode Nine.</p>

<h3>The Guardians of the Galaxyz Trilogy</h3>
<p>By far the best of the Marvelverse movies, these three must be watched together.  The third movie proved that even though it is enjoyable on its own, when watched together with the other two movies it becomes a masterpiece, capping off what will be known in the future as one of the greatest trilogies.</p>

<h3>27 Dresses</h3>
<p>A prime example of a rom-com at its best.  The jokes have not aged and the plot remains relevant even for todays audience.  O.k., so the lead reporter would probably not be working for a newspaper today, but rather be a part of a Wedding LifeStyle Blog.</p>
